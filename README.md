# MUIDataTable-MUI-V5
This the updated MUIDataTable that works fine with Material ui V5 update
# NOTE
This is just a personal update for the origin repo of the MUIDataTable https://github.com/gregnb/mui-datatables
# How to get it working
- copy the dependecies from the package.json inside your project dependency
- Then run <code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn install</code>
- copy the repo folder (mui-datatable) inside your react project's component folder and import it locally inside your components where you would like to use the MUIDataTable.
