# MUIDataTable-MUI-V5
This the updated MUIDataTable that works fine with Material ui V5 update
# NOTE
This is just a personal update for the origin repo of the MUIDataTable https://github.com/gregnb/mui-datatables
# How to get it working
- copy the repo folder inside your react project's component folder and import it locally inside your components where you would like to use the MUIDataTable.
